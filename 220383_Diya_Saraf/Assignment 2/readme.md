Part 1:  Implementing logistic regression using Python (both scratch and sk learn) to perform classification on Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset. The Python script loads a dataset, preprocesses it, and performs logistic regression using both a custom implementation (from scratch) and scikit-learn for comparison. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and features are processed with scaling methods (raw data, normalization, and standardization). Accuracy is evaluated for each method, with scikit-learn consistently providing the most accurate predictions.


Part 2:  Implementing k-NN using Python (both scratch and sk learn) to perform classification on IRIS dataset. The Python script uses Pandas to load the Iris dataset, visualizes it with scatter plots, and splits it into training and testing sets. It then implements k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification from scratch, plotting accuracy against varying k values. Additionally, scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier is employed for comparison, with accuracy plotted similarly.
