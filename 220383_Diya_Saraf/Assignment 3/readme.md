The task is to classify if the wine provided is good based on its physicochemical properties. 

Methodology:
1. Create a new column on the dataset with binary values (i.e, 0 or 1) telling whether the wine is of good quality or not
2. Perform the necessary data pre-processing steps (i,e, cleaning data,  creating a correlation matrix, dealing with outliers, normalising data, etc)
3. Apply following classification algorithms on the given dataset: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier
4. Evaluate models based on the accuracy score and f1 score obtained on the test dataset
